# HORISEON

### Horiseon is a search engine optimizacion, online reputacion management and social media marketing website, our objective is to refactor the original code making sure it uses semantic elements and to optimize time and effort in CSS code, to achieve that I have changed all of the div elements in the original code to more semantic options, also consolidated CSS clases which contained the same atributes to minimize clutter. And last I resized the article boxes and modified their contents to match the lenght of the aside element.
